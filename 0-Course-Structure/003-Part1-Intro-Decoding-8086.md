# Intro to 8086/88
- Moving data from memory to register 
- Do some stuff with data
- Give data back to memory

# Instruction Decode
- Instruction Decode happens on CPU
## mnemonic
- mov => copy (Nothing's being moved)

## How to decode Instruction?
- Instruction Encoding from 8086 Family Users Manual

# Installation
- Install NASM Disassembler
- nasm single_register_move.asm

# Homework
- Disassemble the asm & print out the result
- 1. EX: <code>sim8086 listing_0037_single_register_move.asm</code> for disasssembled output
- 2. EX: <code>fc listing_0037_single_register_move and TEST</code> for differences
