# Register Renaming (0 ~ 10)
- We will talk about this later
# Python over C++ (10 ~ 13)  
- Quick, Not care about where things are going
# Performance & Hardware (13 ~ 19)
- Performance-aware programming vs. Optimization
# Compiler & CPU Designer (19 ~ 21)
# Real Code practice (21 ~ 23)
# Figure out waste for entire code (22 ~ 26)
- "How often is our CPU doing that "ADD" as opposed to everything else is doing" => leads waste problem
- Profiler
# Optimization (26 ~ 28)
- Think about limiting factors
- - EX: "CPU/sec" "bytes/sec" "what kind of cache" 
# Focusing on Asymptotic performance (28 ~ 29)
- O(N), O(N^2), O(NLogN), etc are important
# Performance (30 ~ 33)

# SIMD Signed/Unsigned (33 ~ 44)
- Twos complement
- m128i
- _mm_add_eqi32

# SIMD & Compiler (44 ~ 47)
- Auto-vectorization for some compiler (It's case by case)

# Intel & AMD for SIMD (47 ~ 50)
- Same
 
# CPU (50 ~ 56)
- Register
- - Scaler Value: 64 bits
- - SIMD (or Vector) Value: 256 or 512 bits

# SIMD vs. GPU (56 ~ 1:04)
- GPU is another SIMD CPU in your machine
- CPU => High Clock, High IPC
- GPU => Low Clock, More ALUs, More Queues, More Hyperthread
- GPU is more SIMD unit than CPU

# Deterministic CPU (1:04 ~ 1:09)
- To maximize performance
 
# SSE & AVX (1:09 ~ 1:11)

# ARM CPU (1:11 ~ 1:15)
- ARM CPU is much more basic

# SIMD 32 BIT & Overflow (1:15 ~ 1:19)

# SSE & Clock Speed (1:19 - 1:21)

# SIMD & Hardware Compatibility (1:21 ~ 1:24)
- Not every PC has AVX512 support
- Use CPU ID let CPU tell what instruction they have

# Debug for SIMD (1:24 ~ 1:35)
- Only Debugging feature for CPU is assembly langauge
- CPU & Out-of-Order Operation
- Stall for Memory fence instruction

# SIMD Array (1:35 ~ 1:43)
- "SHOT" "Tail"
- PAD
- Masking
- PACKED Instruction sets
- VECTOR Instruction sets
- Avoid Scalor loop if you can

# SIMD Circuit (1:43 ~ )

# ??? (1:44 ~) 

# Overhead using SIMD (1:45 - 1:50)
- no overhead but tends to be more latant
- Latency: How long it takes to compute
- Throughput: 

# Load Unit (1:50 ~ 1:54)

# CPU Design (1:54 ~ 2:01)
- Register file & Lane

<!-- CACHING -->
<details>
    <summary>2:00 ~ 2:30</summary>

# Controlling the Cache (2:01 ~ 2:09)
- You don't get very much for cache control
- You can give hints for what kind of cache you want to do 
- - 1. Pre-fetch instruction (Bring the value into the cache)
- - 2. Streaming instruction (Not going to read again, so don't store in L1, L2, or L3)
- - - - Streaming Load: 
- - - - Streamng Store:
