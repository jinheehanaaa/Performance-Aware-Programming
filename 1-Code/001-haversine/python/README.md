The script imports the necessary modules including 'math', 'time', and 'json' to perform the operations needed.

It opens the 'points.json' file and reads the input data using 'json.load' function.

The 'HaversineOfDegrees' function is defined which takes in four arguments: (X0, Y0, X1, Y1) representing the latitude and longitude of two points and 'R' representing the Earth's radius in kilometers. The function uses these values to calculate the haversine formula for calculating distance between two points on a sphere.

The code then sets the Earth's radius in kilometers and initializes 'Sum' and 'Count' variables to zero.

A loop iterates over the 'pairs' key in the 'JSONInput' dictionary and calculates the haversine distance between each pair of points using the 'HaversineOfDegrees' function. The results are accumulated in the 'Sum' variable and 'Count' is incremented.

The average haversine distance is then calculated and stored in the 'Average' variable.

The time taken to read the input data is stored in the 'Input' variable by taking the difference between 'MidTime' and 'StartTime'. Similarly, the time taken to perform the calculations is stored in the 'Math' variable by taking the difference between 'EndTime' and 'MidTime'.

The total time taken is stored in the 'Total' variable by taking the difference between 'EndTime' and 'StartTime'.

Finally, the code prints the average haversine distance, the time taken to read the input data, the time taken to perform the calculations, the total time taken, and the throughput which is calculated as 'Count/(EndTime - StartTime)'.
